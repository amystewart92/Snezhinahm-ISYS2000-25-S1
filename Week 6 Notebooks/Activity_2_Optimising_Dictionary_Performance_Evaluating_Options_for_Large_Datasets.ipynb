        "Dictionaries are a fundamental data structure in Python, providing efficient key-value storage and retrieval. However, as dataset sizes grow, the performance of standard dictionaries can degrade. In this activity, you will explore various techniques for optimising dictionary performance, evaluating their trade-offs, and applying them to solve real-world problems.\n",
