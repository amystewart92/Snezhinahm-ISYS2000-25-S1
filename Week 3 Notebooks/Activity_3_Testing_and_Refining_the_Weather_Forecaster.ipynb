        "One way to make your code more robust is to check that the input is numeric before converting it to an integer. For example, you might use the methods `isdigit()` and `startswith()`.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **`isdigit()`**  \n",
        "  This method checks if all the characters in a string are digits (0-9). For example:  \n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  \"123\".isdigit()  # Returns True\n",
        "  \"12a\".isdigit()  # Returns False\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`startswith()`**  \n",
        "  This method checks if a string starts with a specified substring. For instance, to check if a string starts with a minus sign (`\"-\"`):  \n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  \"-123\".startswith(\"-\")  # Returns True\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "When dealing with potential negative numbers (like `\"-5\"`), we can use string indexing. For example, `temp_input[1:]` gives the part of the string after the minus sign.  \n",
        "> **Advanced Concept:**  \n",
        "> A string in Python is a sequence of characters, which means you can access individual characters or a part of the string using indexing or slicing (like `temp_input[1:]`). This technique is a bit advanced for now, but just know that it lets us check if the rest of a string consists entirely of digits even if it starts with a minus sign. You don't need to master this right now; it's enough to have an intuitive idea that we can look at parts of a string.\n",

        "        temperature = int(temp_input)\n",
